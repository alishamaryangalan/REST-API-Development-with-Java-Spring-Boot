# REST-API-Development-with-Java-Spring-Boot

1.	Developed a versatile REST API in Java and Spring, utilizing Redis for efficient storage and retrieval of structured JSON data, and implementing comprehensive CRUD operations and merge/patch support.
2.	Ensured data security through the incorporation of RS256 security mechanisms and industry-standard tools such as Postman, Etag, JWT, and OAuth2.0, enabling seamless API testing and authentication.
3.	Leveraged Elastic Search and Kibana for powerful real-time search and data visualization, while integrating RabbitMQ as a message broker for asynchronous communication between microservices, enhancing system scalability and responsiveness.

Steps to run:
1. cd into Elasticsearch folder in local, and run bin/elasticsearch
2. cd into Kibana folder in local, and run bin/kibana
3. start redis and rabbitmq services
4. brew services start rabbitmq
5. brew services start redis
6. Run the project
