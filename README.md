# REST-API-Development-with-Java-Spring-Boot

1. Developed a versatile REST API in Java and Spring Boot for handling structured JSON data. Implemented CRUD operations, merge/patch, and deletion for efficient data management.
2. Stored data securely in a key/value store with RS256 security mechanisms. Utilized Postman, Etag, JWT, and OAuth2.0 for seamless API testing and authentication.
3. Ensured data integrity with validation support and employed advanced semantics like update if not changed and conditional read/write operations.
